Visual C++ project that demonstrates the use of template based wrapper around WaitForMultipleObjects Windows API that I developed

# Introduction
This code demonstrates how to use WFMOHandler<>, a C++ template based wrapper around the infamous Windows 
WaitForMultipleObjects API. Anyone who has some interest in C++ templates, especially function templates, would find this
work interesting.

# Notes
This code was originally published as part of an article for codeproject.com. I actually split this effort into two articles -- the first one explains the process of designing the basic API and the second one adds timer support to the API. You can find the two articles at the two links below:
