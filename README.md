Visual C++ project that demonstrates the use of template based wrapper around WaitForMultipleObjects Windows API that I developed

# Introduction
This code demonstrates how to use WFMOHandler<>, a C++ template based wrapper around the infamous Windows WaitForMultipleObjects 
API.

# Notes
This code was originally published as part of an article for codeproject.com. I'm archiving the code here as part of an effort to
centralize all my open source contributions. You can find the original article that explains how to use the code at
