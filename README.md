Visual C++ project that demonstrates the use of template based wrapper around WaitForMultipleObjects Windows API that I developed

# Introduction
This code demonstrates how to use WFMOHandler<>, a C++ template based wrapper around the infamous Windows WaitForMultipleObjects 
API.

# Notes
This code was originally published as part of an article for codeproject.com. I'm archiving the code here as part of an effort to centralize all my open source contributions. I actually wrote split this effort into two articles -- the first one
explains the process of designing the basic API and the second one adds timer support to the API. You can find the two articles
